# Berit Janssen

I am a research software engineer at the [Amsterdam Music Lab](https://www.amsterdammusiclab.nl/) (University of Amsterdam), and also worked at the Research Software Lab of Utrecht University's [Centre for Digital Humanities] (https://cdh.uu.nl/).

I conducted PhD research at the Dutch [Meertens Institute](https://meertens.knaw.nl/en/) and the [Music Cognition Group](https://www.mcg.uva.nl/) of the University of Amsterdam, applying computational approaches to study melodic stability in the Meertens Intitute's [Dutch folk song collection](http://www.liederenbank.nl/), leading up to my doctorate in 2018. My dissertation, titled "Retained or Lost in Transmission? Analyzing and Predicting Stability in Dutch Folk Songs" can be found [here](https://www.illc.uva.nl/Research/Publications/Dissertations/DS-2018-01.text.pdf).

Before my academic work, I developed my interests in music technology and education at [STEIM](https://steim.org/) and the [Digital Arts Lab](https://ckc-zoetermeer.nl/aanbod/digital-art-lab/).

My educational background is a M.A. in Musicology and English Literature at the University of Hamburg. I also studied Composition and Music Production as a guest student at Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.
